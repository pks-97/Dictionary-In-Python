# Dictionary-In-Python
A python dictionary that you can use when you are struggling with english!
This is a project for all the people that suffer with english!

The point of the program was to get some more familiarity with pythin to be honest. Okay so the program works in the following way:-

You write in a word in english that you do not know the meaning of and the program returns the meaning of the word!

The data of the word and their meanings are provided by the data.json file and some of the main features of the code is that it works even
if you do not enter an english word that does not exist, so what it does is that it would suggest you words on the basis of the closest possible english
word that matches your mistyped word!

For running the code you must have python2 installed in your system. After you have python you must have difflib in your system. Just run 

pip install difflib   and you would be done.

Try running the code!
